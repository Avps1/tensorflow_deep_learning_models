# Deep learning models in TensorFlow

This repository contains jupyter notebooks implementing several deep learning models.
Each notebook contains detailed explanations about each model, hopefully making it easy to understand the steps.

Models:
- Variational Autoencoder (file: VAE.ipnyb)

- Recurrent Neural Network, trained on the MNIST datasets. This model uses the dynamic_rnn functionality of TensorFlow and contains several layers of LSTM units.
