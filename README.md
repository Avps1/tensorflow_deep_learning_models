# Deep learning models in TensorFlow

This repository contains jupyter notebooks implementing several deep learning models using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
Each notebook contains detailed explanations about each model, hopefully making it easy to understand all steps.

Models:
- Variational Autoencoder 
- Recurrent Neural Network, trained on the MNIST datasets. This model uses the dynamic_rnn functionality of TensorFlow and contains several layers of LSTM units 


# Disclaimer

These notebooks are using and old version of TensorFlow! Several parts of the code will look different in a newer version of TensorFlow. The notebooks will be adapted to the newest TensorFlow version over the next months.
